This project is a simple parallel file analyzer written in Python.
It scans a selected directory, collects basic information about all files, and prints summary statistics.
The program uses threading because file scanning is I/O-bound (disk operations), so threads are efficient and easy to use.

Features:
---------
- parallel scanning using multiple threads
- producer–consumer architecture with a queue
- collects file size, path and extension

prints:
--------
- total number of files
- total size
- top 10 largest files
- extension statistics (count and total size)

Structure:
--------------
conf/config.py – folder to scan and number of workers
src/producer.py – finds files
src/worker.py – processes files in threads
src/analyzer.py – calculates results
src/main.py – runs everything
tests/ – simple unit tests

HOW TO RUN!!!
__________________
Open file "conf/config.py"
- in this file you can edit the file you want to analyze and how many workers you have

Start the program
- open terminal
- run: python -m src.main
